              We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the health care you are receiving. You are not alone. So far, most medical treatments have been designed for the “average patient” based on the entire population without considering
              individual differences. Under the current model of health care, it is very common to receive medications that do not work. Because every body is different, most people experience side effects when they take medication. The All of Us
              Research Program of Precision Medicine collects and uses diverse sources of data to understand how genetics, environment, lifestyle, and other factors affect disease progression and treatment response for each person. You can join the
              program to help researchers find better treatments in the future.

              We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the health care you are receiving. You are not alone. The biological mechanisms of many diseases are not fully understood. We don’t know whether a disease is caused by genetics,
              lifestyle or anything else. We are not sure why many diseases strike any particular person. The All of Us Research Program of Precision Medicine collects and uses diverse sources of data to understand how genetics, environment,

              We understand your concern. Current medical treatments have been developed mostly based on data from participants of European ancestry and those who have higher education and income. That means scientists cannot evaluate whether or not
              a particular treatment for a disease is more effective for people from other backgrounds. The All of Us Research Program of Precision Medicine collects and uses diverse sources of data from a million participants from all walks of life
              to understand disease risk and progression in all populations. You can join the program to help researchers make health care better and more equal for all of us.

              We understand your concern. The current health care system has many problems. We don’t know whether a disease is caused by genetics, lifestyle or anything else. So medical treatments mostly target the symptoms instead of the causes of
              diseases. Also, treatments are designed for an average patient without considering individual differences. The All of Us Research Program of Precision Medicine will allow researchers to create better tools to identify, prevent, and
              treat disease. You can join the program to help researchers find better ways to prevent and treat different health conditions in the future.
