      <h4 class="qna-introtext">Precision Medicine is different than the current, “one-size-fits-all” method for health care. Precision medicine is health care that is based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. Treatments from precision medicine are not currently available, but if a million or more people participate, new approaches to keeping everyone healthy will be made available.

      <ul class="qna-question">
        What is the purpose of health research?
      <li class="qna-answer">
      Health research involves a process of finding out new things about improving people’s health. Health research is important because we all want to live long and healthy lives. People who do health research are identifying better ways to keep us healthy, and they are discovering new ways to treat diseases. The results from health research may not target your health conditions directly or bring immediate benefits but one day they will help you improve your health.

      <ul class="qna-question">
        Is Precision Medicine the same as the current method of health care?
      <li class="qna-answer">
      Precision Medicine is different than the current, “one-size-fits-all” method for health care. Precision medicine is health care that is based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history. The goal of precision medicine is to be able to tell people the best ways to stay healthy. If someone does get sick, precision medicine may help health care teams find the treatment that will work best. Precision medicine is not currently available, but if a million or more people participate, new approaches to keeping everyone healthy will be made available.

      <li>
      <ul class="qna-question">
        My medication does not work or has uncomfortable side effects. What is the benefit of participating in <i>All of Us</i> Program?
      <li class="qna-answer">
      So far, most medical treatments have been designed for the “average patient” based on the entire population without considering individual differences. Under the current model of health care, it is very common to receive medications that do not work. Because everybody is different, most people experience side effects when they take medication. The All of Us Research Program of Precision Medicine collects and uses diverse sources of data to understand how genetics, environment, lifestyle, and other factors affect disease progression and treatment response for each person. You can join the program to help researchers find better treatments in the future.

      <li>
      <ul class="qna-question">
        My doctor is not sure what causes my condition. What is the benefit of participating in <i>All of Us</i> Program?
      <li class="qna-answer">
      The biological mechanisms of many diseases are not fully understood. We don’t know whether a disease is caused by genetics, lifestyle or anything else. We are not sure why many diseases strike any particular person. The <i>All of Us</i> Research Program of Precision Medicine collects and uses diverse sources of data to understand how genetics, environment, lifestyle, and other factors affect disease risk and progression for each person. You can join the program to help researchers learn more about how to prevent and treat different health conditions.

      <li>
      <ul class="qna-question">
        My health care is not the best because of my demographic background (e.g., race or ethnicity). What can <i>All of Us</i> Program do?
      <li class="qna-answer">
      Current medical treatments have been developed mostly based on data from participants of European ancestry and those who have higher education and income. That means scientists cannot evaluate whether or not a particular treatment for a disease is more effective for people from other backgrounds. The <i>All of Us</i> Research Program of Precision Medicine collects and uses diverse sources of data from a million participants from all walks of life to understand disease risk and progression in all populations. You can join the program to help researchers make health care better and more equal for all of us.

      <ul class="qna-question">
        I think health care technology is not advanced. What can <i>All of Us</i> Program do?
      <li class="qna-answer">
      We understand your concern. The current health care system has many problems. We don’t know whether a disease is caused by genetics, lifestyle or anything else. So medical treatments mostly target the symptoms instead of the causes of diseases. Also, treatments are designed for an average patient without considering individual differences.
