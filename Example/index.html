Insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid, usually cover <em>most expenses</em> of medical treatment. Although the cost of new medicines or forms of treatment might not be covered, you can ask us whether the sponsor of the study (like the government or drug company) will pay these expenses.

Many people only want a treatment that has already been tested while other people really want only a new type of treatment. And that’s okay. However, <span class="highlight">being certain that only one treatment is right for you might mean that a clinical trial is not right for you</span> since treatments given in a clinical trial treatment are often randomized.

In some clinical trials, patients are put into groups. Each group receives a different treatment. The process of assigning patients to these groups by chance is called randomization.

In a clinical trial that includes randomization, you and your doctor do not choose which treatment you will get. Instead, a computer assigns you to a group. Randomization helps us learn a lot about how well each treatment works. <span class="highlight">People who are comfortable with randomization tend to be more likely to join a clinical trial.</span>

                      In a clinical trial that includes randomization, you and your doctor do not choose which treatment you will get. Instead, a computer assigns you to a group.

                        It is true that being in a research study or clinical trial can involve extra time or effort, or that require sharing information about your medical condition. However, your family may be glad to know that you can be helpful to future cancer patients even if you just donate your time by answering questions about your diet or your lifestyle (or other topics), which can be done on the computer or at home. Both your privacy and your safety are protected in a number of important ways. You can learn about them by watching this video. </p>
